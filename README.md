## Abstract

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a diverse cancer with large differences in its tumour immune microenvironment. HPV-positive tumours often have better clinical outcomes than HPV-negative tumours, but HPV status alone does not fully explain immune variation between patients. This study therefore focused first on immune phenotype, rather than HPV status alone. Using TCGA-HNSC bulk RNA-seq data, immune infiltration was estimated with MCP-counter, ESTIMATE and xCell. Tumours were classified into immune-hot and immune-cold groups. In total, 139 tumours were classified as immune-hot and 381 as immune-cold. Immune-hot tumours showed stronger immune-related signals, including T-cell, B-cell, plasma-cell and antigen-presentation programmes. Immune-cold tumours showed weaker immune activation and relatively stronger metabolic, ribosomal and structural gene-expression programmes.

HPV-positive tumours were significantly enriched in the immune-hot group, but HPV status and immune phenotype were not identical. Many immune-hot tumours were HPV-negative, showing that immune phenotype provides information beyond HPV status. Survival analysis showed that HPV-positive status was associated with better overall survival, while immune-hot/cold status alone was not significantly associated with overall survival.

Single-cell RNA-seq data from GSE181919 were then used to interpret the bulk findings at cell-type level. HPV-associated gene-expression differences were mainly linked to epithelial cells, while B/plasma cells showed the strongest immune-cell-associated signal. Overall, this study shows that HPV status and immune phenotype are related but distinct features of HNSCC biology. Classifying tumours by immune-hot and immune-cold states may help describe tumour immune heterogeneity and guide future studies, but further validation is needed before clinical use.

## Methods implemented

### Stage 1: Bulk RNA-seq (TCGA-HNSC)

| Step | Implementation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Immune deconvolution | MCP-counter, xCell and ESTIMATE (immunedeconv) | Three independent estimates of immune infiltration |
| Immune groups | Clustering on deconvolution scores, with one tool held out | Keeps an independent method for validation |
| Differential expression | DESeq2 Wald test with apeglm LFC shrinkage | Shrinkage stabilises fold changes for low-count genes |
| Pathways | clusterProfiler ORA and GSEA (GO BP, KEGG) | GSEA catches coordinated sub-threshold shifts that ORA misses |
| Survival | Kaplan–Meier, log-rank, uni- and multivariable Cox PH | Tests whether the immune phenotype is prognostic independently of HPV |

### Stage 2: Single-cell RNA-seq

| Step | Implementation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| QC | 3 × MAD on log10 counts / genes / mito%, computed **per tissue type** | Library complexity differs by tissue, so one global cutoff would over- or under-filter |
| Normalisation | SCTransform v2 (glmGamPoi), regressing mito% | Removes sequencing-depth and mitochondrial technical variance |
| Clustering | PCA → shared-nearest-neighbour graph → Louvain → UMAP | PCs chosen from the elbow plot; checkpoints saved after expensive steps |
| Annotation | SingleR (celldex reference) + canonical marker panels | Combines reference-based labels with marker validation |
| Differential expression | Pseudobulk DESeq2 (counts summed per patient per cell type), then ORA / GSEA | Avoids pseudo-replication from treating cells of one patient as independent |

## Reproducibility practices

- Scripts numbered in run order, one analysis stage per script
- All paths relative to the project root, with no machine-specific paths
- Package versions pinned with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)
- Checkpoints saved after expensive steps (SCTransform, clustering), so the
  pipeline can resume after a failure
- Raw data and outputs kept out of version control
